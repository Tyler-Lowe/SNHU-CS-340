README for CS 340 Portfolio Submission
Project Two Artifacts
This repository contains the following artifacts from my CS 340 Project Two:

Dashboard Code: The Python code used to create the dashboard application for Grazioso Salvare, including the MongoDB CRUD Python module and the dashboard widgets.
Project Two README: A Word document that explains the project functionality, tools used, and instructions for reproducing the dashboard.
Responses to Reflection Questions
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When writing programs, I focus on clean, modular code. For example, the CRUD Python module from Project One was designed to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in a reusable way. This module was directly incorporated into Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database, allowing for consistent and centralized data handling. Working this way ensures that the code is easy to update or adapt for other projects. In the future, this module could be used in other applications that require database interaction, such as inventory systems or user management systems.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I break problems into smaller, manageable tasks. For the dashboard, I started by understanding Grazioso Salvare’s requirements, like filtering data by rescue type or visualizing data with charts. I then designed and implemented the components step-by-step, testing each one individually. Compared to previous assignments, this project required a more structured approach because it involved integrating a database, CRUD operations, and interactive UI elements. In future projects, I would use the same strategy: thoroughly analyze requirements, plan out each task, and iteratively build and test the application.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by developing software and systems that make tasks more efficient and effective. In this project, the dashboard I built helps Grazioso Salvare quickly identify rescue dogs that meet specific criteria, saving time and improving decision-making. Projects like these matter because they empower organizations to focus on their core mission—in this case, training rescue animals—by providing them with the tools to work smarter, not harder. My work on this dashboard could be extended to similar use cases for other organizations, showcasing the practical impact of computer science.
